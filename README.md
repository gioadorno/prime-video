# Prime Video

Created a personal project recreating Prime Video utilizing Next JS. This is a couple years old and has not been updated since.

A recreation of Prime video utilizing a public movie database. This should always be up to date with the newest movie data. 

Note: This does not play any movies, but there are trailers brought in from youtube (Some may not work).
